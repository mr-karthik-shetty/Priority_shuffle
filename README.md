# Priority_shuffle
Based on my own music playing habits, I realized that while I enjoyed the unpredictability of shuffled playlists, I preferred to see recently added songs more while shuffling. To achieve this, my algorithm uses balanced binary trees in which higher priority elements occupy nodes closer to the root. The algorithm selects a random element from a randomly selected path from the root to the leaf. and Since elements closer to the root belong to more paths, they have a higher probability of being picked next. Moreover, due to the fixed probabilities of elements at each level, the algorithm picks each element in a single traversal and hence has a time complexity of to shuffle n log(n) elements.
